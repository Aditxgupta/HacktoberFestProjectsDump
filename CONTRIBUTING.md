## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Submitting New Projects
We accept a wide variety of open-source projects. To submit a new project:

- Fork the repository.

- Add all the necessary files and documentation related to your project inside this folder.
- Make sure your project meets the following criteria:
  - It includes a `README.md` file with an overview of the project.
  - It contains at least one executable or script file related to the project.
  - The project is beginner-friendly and open to collaboration.
- Once you're done, open a pull request with the details of your project.

### 2. Improving Existing Projects
If you would like to improve an existing project:

- Look for issues tagged with `enhancement`, `bug`, or `good first issue`.
- Fork the repository and make the necessary changes in your fork.
- Ensure that your changes improve the project without breaking any existing functionality.
- Commit your changes and submit a pull request, detailing what you’ve done.

### 3. Reporting Bugs
If you encounter any issues with a project:

- Check if the issue has already been reported.
- If not, create a new issue with a detailed description of the bug and, if possible, steps to reproduce it.
- Make sure to include relevant labels like `bug` or `help wanted`.

### 4. Requesting Features
If you have an idea for a new feature:

- Open an issue describing the feature, explaining its purpose and how it can enhance the project.
